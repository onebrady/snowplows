- Verified application works correctly with new 6-section layout
- Captured current state screenshot for reference
- Updated 3 critical test files (sections-smoke, content-presence, consistency)
- Documented remaining test file updates needed

**ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (Start here next session):
1. **Continue Phase 5**: Fix remaining Playwright test failures
2. **Update remaining test files**: group-titles-order.spec.ts, sections-screenshots.spec.ts, downloads.spec.ts
3. **Run full test suite**: Verify all functionality works
4. **Complete Phase 5 checklist**: Performance, accessibility, final validation

**ðŸ”§ KEY TECHNICAL NOTES**:
- Dev server running on http://localhost:5173 
- All 6 sections working: Equipment (16 Q&As), Integration (16), Operations (16), Environment (8), Procurement (10), Technology (8)
- Microtools preserved and functional in new sections
- Test failures are due to section slug changes only - core functionality confirmed working
