      question: "What is Olympus?",
      answer:
        'An integrated plow/spreader/dump control platform with a 12" touch display and a 2-axis joystick. One harness, one brain, less troubleshooting.',

      id: "controls-q2",
      question: "Why integrated vs. piecemeal?",
      answer:
        "Unified wiring, shared diagnostics, and faster upfits; features added via configuration, not rewiring.",

      id: "controls-q3",

        "Dead-man trigger, day/night modes, glove-friendly targets, and logical function grouping reduce errors in storms.",

      id: "controls-q4",
      question: "How do presets and interlocks help?",
      answer:
        "Route presets set rates and blade modes in one tap. Interlocks prevent unsafe combos (e.g., travel speed with wing extended).",

      id: "controls-q5",
      question: "Diagnostics and serviceability?",

        "On-screen faults, I/O status views, and event logs speed troubleshooting. Standardized modules simplify spares and training.",

      question: "Can it integrate with telematics?",

      id: "controls-q7",
      question: "Installation considerations?",

        "Protect harness runs, use drip loops, avoid pinch points, and label connections. Allow service access around hydraulic valves.",
