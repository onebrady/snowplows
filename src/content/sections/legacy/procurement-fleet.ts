        "Include lifecycle costs: uptime, parts commonality, fuel/liquid usage, and resale. Score safety and training support, not just purchase price.",

      id: "proc-q2",
      question: "Spec writing—what avoids protest risk?",
      answer:
        "Performance-based specs with verifiable tests, at least two compliant paths, and clear evaluation criteria. Avoid brand lock-in unless justified.",
